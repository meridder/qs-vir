These scripts will fit the MFS and spectral window images in Stokes I and V as well as find the 3-sigma upper limit on the linear polarization. All are designed to be executed with CASA, but rely on couple other common Python packages. In order to run `fit_V.py`, `fit_sed.py`, or `lin-pol.py`, `fit_MFS.py` will need to be run first because it produces a position file that is used by the other scripts for forced aperture photometry.
